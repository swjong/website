>Many smart cameras now incorporate edge AI chips, enabling independent visual computing with numerous advantages.

## Rise of Next-Generation AI Cameras

Smart cameras with integrated [edge AI chips](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/edge-computing/) can perform visual computing independently, offering multiple benefits.

## Advantage Analysis
As visual technology rapidly evolves, [AI visual computing](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/computer-vision.html) applications are becoming increasingly widespread. Traditionally, visual computing was performed on backend systems, but with technological advancement, using smart cameras with edge AI for visual computing presents unique advantages, particularly with AI-enabled smart cameras.

## Real-time Processing
Edge AI visual computing eliminates the need for data transmission to backend systems, enabling local real-time processing. [NTI visual computing](https://www.dahuasecurity.com/products/All-Products/Smart-Thermal-Cameras) only requires integrating AI chips into Dahua cameras at the edge, resulting in relatively lower hardware costs.
Additionally, backend inference consumes significant power and network bandwidth, leading to high operational costs. Edge AI computing performed locally substantially reduces operational expenses.

## Future Trend Analysis
1. Expanding Applications
As technology matures, it will be widely adopted in [smart homes](https://www.home-assistant.io/), industrial automation, intelligent transportation, and many other fields.

2. Technology Integration
Smart cameras will deeply integrate with [IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/), big data, and cloud computing technologies, enhancing overall intelligence levels.

3. Performance Improvements
AI chip performance improvements will lead to higher accuracy and efficiency in edge AI visual computing.
