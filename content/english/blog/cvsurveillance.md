## What is computer vision

**Computer vision** is a subfield of **artificial intelligence (AI)** that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from images or videos. In the context of **physical security**, computer vision can be used to analyze video feeds and detect various types of activity, such as:

## How computer vision can help you

1. **Object detection** 
Identify specific objects within a scene, such as people, vehicles, luggage, or packages.
2. **Anomaly detection**: 
Detect unusual or unexpected behavior, such as loitering, trespassing, or suspicious package handling.
3. **Motion detection**: 
Trigger alerts when motion is detected in a specific area, such as a doorway, corridor, or parking lot.
4. **Facial recognition**: 
Identify individuals by their facial features and track their movement within the surveillance area.
5. **Multi Object tracking**: 
Follow the movement of multiple objects (e.g., people, vehicles) across multiple cameras and zones.

## Why 5G make deployment easier than ever

Computer vision for surveillance is already a powerful tool, and when combined with the speed, reliability, and low latency of 5G networks. We partner with China Mobile in several deployments in Hong Kong:
1. **Faster Video Streaming**: With 5G's ultra-high-speed network capabilities (up to 20 Gbps), you can stream high-definition video feeds in real-time, 
reducing latency and ensuring that critical surveillance data is transmitted quickly.
2. **Real-Time Analytics**: Leverage the low-latency benefits of 5G to enable real-time analytics on computer vision algorithms, allowing for faster 
detection and response times when anomalies are detected.
3. **Edge Computing**: Utilize edge computing capabilities in 5G networks to process video feeds closer to the source (e.g., cameras), reducing latency and 
increasing processing power.
4. **AI-Powered Insights**: Combine 5G's ultra-low latency with AI-powered computer vision insights to enable real-time decision-making, such as sending 
alerts for potential security breaches or detecting suspicious activity in areas like airports or seaports.
5. **Cloud-Based Services**: Integrate 5G connectivity with cloud-based services to enable remote monitoring, real-time analytics, and centralized management of surveillance systems.
