## What is Visual Computing?

>Visual Computing, a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables computers to understand and interpret visual information from video feeds and respond accordingly. When applied to **property security**, visual computing can analyze video sources to detect various activities and automatically identify suspicious behavior, significantly reducing manual monitoring requirements.

## How Visual Computing Reduces Operational Costs

1. **Object Detection**
   - Automatic identification of specific objects in scenes
   - Recognition of people, vehicles, luggage, and packages
   - Real-time monitoring and alerts

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Automatic detection of unusual activities or incidents
   - Monitoring for loitering, trespassing, or suspicious package handling
   - Immediate alert system for security breaches

3. **Motion Detection**
   - Triggers alerts when movement is detected in designated areas
   - Monitors specific zones like entrances, corridors, or parking lots
   - Detects activities such as smoking or sports activities
   
4. **Facial Recognition**
   - Identifies individuals through facial features
   - Tracks movement within monitored areas
   - Maintains security access control

5. **Multi-object Tracking**
   - Simultaneous tracking of multiple objects
   - Monitors people, vehicles, and animals
   - Coordinates across multiple cameras and zones

## How 5G Simplifies Visual Computing Deployment

Current surveillance visual computing has evolved into a powerful collaborative tool, enhanced by 5G network's speed, reliability, and low latency. Our successful deployments in partnership with China Mobile Hong Kong (CMHK) demonstrate these advantages:

1. **High-Speed Video Streaming**
   - Ultra-fast network capabilities (up to 20 Gbps)
   - Real-time HD video streaming
   - Minimal latency for critical surveillance data transmission

2. **Real-Time Analysis**
   - Leverages 5G's low latency
   - Enables instant computer vision algorithm analysis
   - Provides rapid response to detected anomalies

3. **Edge Computing**
   - Processes video streams near the source
   - Reduces network latency
   - Enhances processing capabilities at camera locations

4. **AI-Driven Insights**
   - Combines 5G ultra-low latency with AI analytics
   - Enables real-time decision making
   - Monitors suspicious activities in critical areas

5. **Cloud-Based Services**
   - Integrates 5G connectivity with cloud services
   - Enables remote monitoring capabilities
   - Provides centralized surveillance system management
