<!-- about content -->

Founded in 1991, Charmtop Consultants is an IT system integrator that offers practical advisory on system architecture, management, storage, security and messaging both on UNIX and Windows platforms. 

We understand business continuity is critical for today's business, and IT expertise is such a scarcity. With a monthly retainer program, we provide ongoing support for monitoring and housekeeping of IT infrastructure, including router/Firewall, VPN setup, messaging systems and remote access/mobile services.
