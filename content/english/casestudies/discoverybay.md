Using visual computing technology, real-time surveillance through video cameras can monitor the site and transmit data to a processing center via 5G networks for target identification and suspicious activity detection, triggering immediate alerts for action. This solution has been successfully implemented in Hong Kong residential estates, providing 24/7 coastal monitoring. When unauthorized vessels attempt to intrude, the system immediately notifies security personnel, resulting in successful prevention of multiple illegal entry attempts.
